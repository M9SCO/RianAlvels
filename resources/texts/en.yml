  About this bot.
  
  Various uses:
  /d100
  /20d20
  d11
  3d4+1
  d6+d4
  /2d20h - roll 2 times and take the highest roll
  4d6h3 - roll 4 hexagonal dice and take the 3 highest rolls
  20d12+3x10 - roll 20 times, add to result 3, repeat 10 times
  
  How it works:
  {throws}[dkdc]{faces}, where 
  {throws} - how many random results to get;
  [dkdk] - one of the delimiters listed;
  {faces} - the number of faces of the dice to throw.
  To highlight the [number] larger or smaller roll results, use {roll}[hв]{number} or {roll}[lн]{number} respectively.
  To repeat multiple [times] identical rolls, use [times]x[throws] or [throws]x[times]
  The bot supports the following arithmetic operations on dice and numbers "+", "-", "*", "/".
  Аnd also prioritizes actions, when using round and square brackets "((", ")", "[", "]"" 
  If you want to calling the rolling dice bot only "/", use command /only_slash. Calling it again will disable this option
  
  To open the keyboard of the commonly used dice, press /kb, /keyboard, and to close /hide.
  You can create your own keyboard for the commonly used dice by continuing the /kb or /keyboard command, separating future buttons " /":
  /kb /2d20h /d20 /2d20l /d20+1 /d20+2 /d6+k4 - compose a keyboard with 6 quick dial buttons
